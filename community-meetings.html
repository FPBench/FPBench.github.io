        The Herbie web demo is intended as an accessible tool for making a
        rough guess at the best way to improve the accuracy of a floating-point
        expression. It aims to support students learning about floating point
        error, casual users who just want a high-accuracy replacement
        expression, and expert users who are comfortable interpreting its
        results. However, it is designed as a single-step tool and leaves
        little room for users to iterate or adapt it to numerical analysis
        tasks, even though its underlying functions have broader applications.
        We describe how an alternative “database workbench” interface will
        allow users to leverage Herbie’s power while exploring the design space
        of replacement expressions more flexibly, including support for the
        development of third-party expression analysis plugins. We would like
        to discuss with the FPBench community whether the workflow we describe
        is compatible with other numerical analysis tools and needs, either as
        plugins or as separate workbenches with a similar interface.

        RTL development is hampered by low design space exploration and long
        debug times. High Level Synthesis and ML techniques are not tackling
        the nature of optimization RTL teams are doing in complex Graphics type

        associated formal verification and how the foundation of the system is

        Choosing Mathematical Function Implementations for Speed and Accuracy
      </div>
      <div class="speaker">
        Ian Briggs,
        Computer Science,
        University of Utah

      <div class="abstract">

        Standard implementations of functions like sin and exp optimize for
        accuracy, not speed, because they are intended for general-purpose use.
        But just like many applications tolerate inaccuracy from cancellation,
        rounding error, and singularities, many applications could also
        tolerate less-accurate function implementations. This raises an
        intriguing possibility: speeding up numerical code by using different
        function implementations.

        Enter OpTuner, an automated tool for selecting the best implementation
        for each mathematical function call site. OpTuner uses error Taylor
        series and integer linear programming to compute optimal assignments of
        297 function implementations to call sites and presents the user with a
        speed-accuracy Pareto curve. In a case study on the POV-Ray ray tracer,
        OpTuner speeds up a critical computation by 2.48×, leading to a whole
        program speedup of 1.09× with no change in the program output; human
        efforts result in slower code and lower-quality output. On a broader
        study of 36 standard benchmarks, OpTuner demonstrates speedups of 2.05×
        for negligible decreases in accuracy and up to 5.37× for error-tolerant
        applications.

        Automated Discovery of Invertibility Conditions via Syntax-Guided Synthesis

        Andrew Reynolds,
        Computer Science,
        University of Iowa
      </div>
      <div class="abstract">

        Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers have gained widespread
        popularity as reasoning engines in numerous formal methods
        applications, including in syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS)
        applications. In this talk, we focus on an emerging class of
        applications for syntax-guided synthesis, namely, the use of a SyGuS
        solver to (partially) automate further development and improvements to
        the SMT solver itself. We describe several recent features in the SMT
        solver cvc5 that follow this paradigm. These include syntax-guided
        enumeration of rewrite rules, selection of test inputs, and discovery
        of solved forms for quantified constraints. For the latter, we describe
        how syntax-guided synthesis recently played a pivotal role in the
        development of a new algorithm for quantified bit-vector constraints
        based on invertibility conditions, and how this technique can be
        extended for similar algorithms that target quantified constraints in
        other theories, including the theory of floating points.

        Lazy Exact Real Arithmetic Using Floating Point Operations

        Ryan McCleeary,
        Research Engineer,

      </div>
      <div class="abstract">

        Exact real arithmetic systems can specify any amount of precision on
        the output of the computations. They are used in a wide variety of
        applications when a high degree of precision is necessary. Some of
        these applications include: differential equation solvers, linear
        equation solvers, large scale mathematical models, and SMT solvers.
        This talk describes a new exact real arithmetic system which uses lazy
        list of floating point numbers to represent the real numbers.  It
        details algorithms for basic arithmetic computations on these
        structures and proves their correctness.  This proposed system has the
        advantage of algorithms which can be supported by modern floating point
        hardware, while still being a lazy exact real arithmetic system

        FPY: The future of FPCore

      <div class="abstract">

        FPY is a new language for specifying benchmarks that is meant to be
        easier to write for larger programs while retaining compatibility with
        existing FPCore-based tools. FPY repackages the precise semantics of
        FPCore under more familiar and convenient Python-like syntax. This
        talk will discuss the prototype design and highlight new conveniences
        FPY affords over FPCore.
