    Formal Methods conference in 2018.</p>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    Recent renewed interest in optimizing and analyzing floating-point
    programs has lead to a diverse array of new tools for numerical programs.
    These tools are often complementary, each focusing on a distinct aspect of
    numerical programming.  Building reliable floating point applications
    typically requires addressing several of these aspects, which makes easy
    composition essential. This paper describes the composition of two recent
    floating-point tools: Herbie, which performs accuracy optimization, and
    Daisy, which performs accuracy verification. We find that the combination
    provides numerous benefits to users, such as being able to use Daisy to check
    whether Herbie's unsound optimizations improved the worst-case roundoff
    error, as well as benefits to tool authors, including uncovering a number of
    bugs in both tools. The combination also allowed us to compare the different
    program rewriting techniques implemented by these tools for the first time.
    The paper lays out a road map for combining other floating-point tools and
    for surmounting common challenges.

  <h2>Paper</h2>

  <p>
    The paper uses the FPBench benchmarks and tooling to combine and
    compare the Herbie and Diasy tools. The paper demonstrates the
    importance of testing combinations of tools and describes some of
    the challenges that had to be surmounted. It is available
    in <a href="fm18-paper.pdf">PDF format</a>. All code described in
    the paper is
    also <a href="https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench/tree/daisy-herbie">freely
    available online</a>.
