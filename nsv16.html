    Numerical Software Verification workshop in 2016.</p>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>

  <blockquote class="abstract">
  We introduce FPBench, a standard benchmark format for validation and
  optimization of numerical accuracy in floating-point computations.
  FPBench is a first step toward addressing an increasing need in our
  community for comparisons and combinations of tools from different
  application domains. To this end, FPBench provides a basic
  floating-point benchmark format and accuracy measures for comparing
  different tools. The FPBench format and measures allow comparing and
  composing different floating-point tools. We describe the FPBench
  format and measures and show that FPBench expresses benchmarks from
  recent papers in the literature, by building an initial benchmark
  suite drawn from these papers. We intend for FPBench to grow into a
  standard benchmark suite for the members of the floating-point tools
  research community.

  <h2>Paper</h2>

  <p>
    The paper presents the motivation behind FPBench and describes a
    preliminary version of the <a href="spec/">FPBench standards</a>.
    It is available in <a href="nsv16-paper.pdf">PDF format</a> or
    as <a href="https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench/tree/master/papers/nsv16">TeX
    sources</a>. All code described in the paper is
    also <a href="https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench/">freely
    available online</a>.

    The talk was delivired by <a href="https://pavpanchekha.com">Pavel
    Panchekha</a> in a 20 minute slot
    on <time datetime="2016-07-17T15:05:00Z+05:00">17th July at
    15:00</time>. We recorded another take a week after the conference
    with the same slides, which you can watch below. You can also
    download the slides in <a href="nsv16-slides.pptx">Powerpoint</a>
    format or <a href="nsv16-slides.pdf">PDF</a> format.
